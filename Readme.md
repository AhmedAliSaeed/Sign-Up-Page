Hi...
This is a solution to the "Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor"

-> The Challange

    Users should be able to:

        - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
        - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
        - Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
        - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
        - The email address is not formatted correctly

-> Screenshot
    You Will Find it in the File named "screenshots"
